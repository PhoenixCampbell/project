# 📘 Faculty–Class Match System

_A full-stack DSU scheduling support system for collecting faculty preferences, running a solver, and generating optimized teaching assignments._

## 🧭 Project Overview

Faculty–Class Match is a web application built for the Dakota State University Software Engineering course (CSC 470). The system allows:

- **Faculty** to submit course preferences including comfort level & wanting to teach level
- **Administration** to run an automated solver using Python
- **The system** to export a solution Excel file for review

The project is implemented as a **full-stack application** using:

- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** – UI & layout
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – dynamic behavior
- **Express.js (Node)** – backend + API routes
- **Python (solver.py)** – optimization engine
- **CSV file storage** – faculty preference persistence

# 📝 Testing
1. For Python testing run:
    - ```python -m venv match-venv```
    - ```source match-venv/bin/activate```
    - ```pip install pytest```
    - ```pip install pytest-cov```
    - For python unit tests ran individually: ```pytest -vv tests/{file_name}.py```
        - For example: ```pytest -vv tests/test_preferences.py```
    - For a coverage report: ```pytest --cov={file_name} tests/ --cov-report=html```
        - For example: ```pytest --cov=preferences tests/ --cov-report=html``` and multiple ```--cov=...``` can be added to createa coverage report for many files at once
    - Deactivate the virtual environment with: ```deactivate```
    - The coverage report will be created in ```htmlcov/```
2. For javascript testing:
    - Update packages: ```npm install```
    - Run: ```npm test```
    - A report will be created in ```coverage/lcov-report/```

---

# 🐋 Docker
1. To install docker on your machine (Ubuntu):
    - ```sudo apt install docker.io```
    - ```sudo apt install docker-compose```
2. For building project and running and in a docker container:
    - ```sudo docker compose build```
      - If that doesn't work or gives an error about group permissions:
        - ```sudo usermod -aG docker $USER```
        - ``` newgrp docker```
        - ```docker-compose build```
    - Get the docker Image ID using: ```docker images```
    - Run the docker container with:
      ```docker run -p 3000:3000 <Image ID>```
      - Add ```-d``` after the ports if you want to run detached
    - Check that the Docker container is running with: ```docker ps```
