# 🎓 Faculty–Class Match (DSU Beacom College)

A lightweight **Bootstrap 5** web application built by Dakota State University’s CSC 470 Software Engineering team.  
The goal is to provide a simple, intuitive interface where **faculty can rate their course preferences** (0–4) and administrators can later process those preferences with a scheduling solver.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Every semester, departments at DSU must assign courses to faculty.  
This project aims to simplify that process through a web interface that collects faculty preferences, and in future phases, integrates with a solver (Google OR-Tools) to recommend optimal assignments.

This semester’s focus _(Fall 2025)_:

- Design a clean, responsive **frontend prototype**
- Implement pages using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**
- Prepare structure for future backend integration (SSO, database, solver, etc.)
